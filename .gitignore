# Virtual environments
# Pipenv's virtual environments are typically stored outside the project root by default.
# However, if you configure PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=true, it will create a .venv/ folder.
# It's good practice to include this just in case, or for other venv types (e.g., venv, virtualenv).
