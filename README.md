# Hypercube: A Really Dope Zoetrope

## Project Overview

*Hypercube: A Really Dope Zoetrope* is a precision-engineered kinematic art installation designed to provide a beautiful 
and tangible representation of four-dimensional space and movement within it. This project embraces a multidisciplinary 
approach, integrating mathematics, coding, and art, where the former two serve as essential tools for creating the latter.

The primary goal of *Hypercube* is to illustrate fundamental geometric properties and the nature of dimension in 
surprising yet intuitive ways. This project is designed to be appreciated by a broad audience, regardless of mathematical
background or lack thereof. 

**_Note:_** _Due to the stroboscopic nature of the installation, this exhibit may not be suitable for individuals with 
seizure-related disorders, such as epilepsy._

## Components

*Hypercube* is composed of several integrated components:

* **Physical Zoetrope:** The main rotational structure is primarily constructed from wood, utilizing 
both manual and digital fabrication techniques.
* **3D Printed Models:** These include a collection lower-dimensional representations of a "unit hypercube" which are animated
stroboscopically by the zeotrope.
* **Drivetrain:** The zoetrope's rotational motion is driven by several stepper motors mechanically coupled to a large drive
gear secured to one side of the main bearing. The gears and bearing plates will be fabricated from wood. 
* **Electronics:** The system's motion and lighting are controlled by an Arduino Mega, which synchronizes the
action of the (multiple) stepper motors and LEDs.
* **Software:** Custom software includes Python scripts for generating 3D models (using OpenSCAD) and controlling the 
zoetrope's operation and functionality.

## Current Status

The project is currently in the **design phase** across all domains.

* Modeling for the zoetrope prototype is complete.
* Prototypes for the 3D-printable hypercube models are nearing completion.
* Work on the electronics system is pending.

The fabrication stage for the zoetrope prototype and 3D printing of the hypercube prototypes are anticipated to commence 
within the next month.

## Exhibition Plans

*Hypercube: A Really Dope Zoetrope* is anticipated to debut at the **2027 Joint Mathematics Meeting (JMM)** in Chicago, 
scheduled for early January. Following its debut, the installation will be in the market for a more permanent home.
